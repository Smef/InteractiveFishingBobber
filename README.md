Improves interactivity of the fishing bobber for a better experience when using the interact key functionality introduced in 10.0

This addon changes the `SoftTargetInteractArc`, `SoftTargetInteractRange`, and `Sound_SFXVolume` values during the fishing cast. Changes are reset when you catch a fish or stop casting.

Changes the following values from their default (whatever you have set) to new values during the fishing cast:

```
SoftTargetInteractArc: 2
SoftTargetInteractRange: 30
Sound_SFXVolume: 1
```
